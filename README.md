Sidans namn, who targets, useful to whom and why?

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The quiz web page consist of one landing page with different sections for the user to explore. Instead of making different pages for the quiz itself, the users score and rules for the quiz I let JavaScript do the talking for this project.

## Testing

The page has been tested on different devices - such as phones, tablets and laptops. Among others the page has been tested on Samsung S22, Iphone 11, Apple Ipad, Goolge Chromebook and a wide screen desktop.

When it comes to phones it has been viewed on five different models to make sure it looks the same depending on the brand and screen size of the phone.

It has been tested in different web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox to make sure everything acts as it should.

The internal links have been tested on both laptop and different mobile devices and works as they should, from all different pages.

The external links works as well, both the social media ones and the ones to different kennels. They all open in a new browser window as indented.

The contact form is responsive and the required part on every row of input works. The autocomplete function also works as i should. When pressing "Send" the form returns information that the form has been prepared and submitted correctly.

Responsivness has been tested on devices as small as 280px in screen size up to 2560px, with the help of Chrome DevTools. Through discussion with my mentor it was desided to keep the page responsive up to a screens size of 1200px, and make it "static" on wider screens so that the content wouldn't look weird and stretched.

No elements overlap when viewed on smaller screens. Some features such as the external links to kennels acts differently depending on screens size - when viewed on smaller devices they appear in a vertical row, on larger devices they instead show up in a horizontal row.

Overall, the layout and functions are easy to access and the page has a clean and simple layout which enables easy access to all parts of the site for the user.
